\section{Similarity with the Knapsack Problem}

\cite{bib:knapsack-problems} gives a definition for a \zoKPV (\zoKP):

\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{problem:knapsack-problem}
	\max & \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} p_j x_j \\
	\subjectedTo
		& \displaystyle\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} w_j x_j \leq c \nonumber\\
		& x_j \in \Set{0, 1} \quad \forall j \in \Set{1, \dots, n} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

in which $p_j$ and $w_j$ are know as the profit and the weight of the item $j$, respectively.

Our problem can be seen as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item a \MKPV (\MKP) since the weight function is multidimensional;
	\item a \zoKP in which the profit of all items are equal (the exact value of the profit depends on how one decide to formulate the problem);
	\item a \zoKP with an extra restriction on how the items can be inserted (or removed) from the knapsack (constraint \eqref{constraint:stacking});
	\item it is still a ``0-1'' problem in the sense that one has to decide whether to remove a specific item or not;
\end{enumerate}
