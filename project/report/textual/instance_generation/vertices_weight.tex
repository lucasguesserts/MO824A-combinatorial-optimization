\subsection{Vertices Weight}

The weight of a vertex is a multidimensiona vector of positive integer entries. To generate it, it is simply as generating some random numbers in a specific range of values and organizing it so that one gets a vector. For this, \cite{bib:numpy} was used.

\subsubsection{Vertices Weight Generation Parameters}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item weight size: the size or dimension of the weight vector;
    \item weight minimum value and weight maximum value: they define the interval in which the values must be;
\end{enumerate}
