\subsection{Greedy Algorithm}

It is a simple algorithm: at each iteration, add the vertex which minimizes the \greedyCriteriaText $\greedy$ and does not violate the \precedenceConstraint (\eqref{eq:precedence-constraint}). When no more vertex can be added without violating the \capacityConstraint (\eqref{eq:capacity-constraint}), stop.

Although being quite easy to define and implement this algorithm, we decided to implement it using GRASP with:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \greedyParameterText $\greedyParameter = 0$. As discussed in \sssref{subsubsection:grasp-construction}, it makes the algorithm purely greedy;
    \item Maximum number of iterations $\nit = 1$. Being purely greedy, there is no randomness, so there is also no need to run it more than once;
\end{enumerate}

% We expect \algref{algorithm:greedy} to give reasonable results very quickly, i.e. to be good for obtaining reasonable results but not near-optimal ones.
