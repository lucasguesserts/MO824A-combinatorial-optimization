We present a generalization of the classic 0-1 Knapsack Problem. First, the weight of the items are multidimensional vectors and so is the knapsack capacity. Second, the profit of all items is equal to one. Third, the items are required to be added in a certain order. That problem is reffered as \textit{Multidimensional Unitary-profit Precedence-constrained Knapsack Problem (MEPKP)}. Three solution approaches are proposed: 1 an Integer Linear Programming for a exact solution; 2 a greedy algorithm for a fast solution; 3 a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures (GRASP) and Tabu Search (TS) for a near optimal solution; The three approaches are compared in terms of quality of the solution and computational time with randomly generated instances. For cases in which the exact solution is not available, a Duality Gap is used to compute the optimality gap.
