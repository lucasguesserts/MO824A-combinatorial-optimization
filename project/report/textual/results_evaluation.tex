\section{How to evaluate the Results}

We will generate a table with the result of the experiments in the format below. Graphics are going to be created on demand as we analyze the results. Such results will provide all the information required to see how each method behaves, how different instances impact on each method, how big is the instance they can handle.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \multirow{2}{*}{Instance} &
            \multicolumn{2}{c|}{ILP} &
            \multicolumn{2}{c|}{greedy} &
            \multicolumn{2}{c|}{metaheuristic} \\
            & no. items & time & no. items & time & no. items & time\\
        \hline\hline
        X & 10 & 100 & 8 & 14 & 9 & 36 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Results of the methods of solution. The time is given in seconds.}
\end{table}
