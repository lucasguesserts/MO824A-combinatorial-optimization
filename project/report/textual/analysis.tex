\section{Analysis of the Results}

Looking at Tables \ref{table:100-results}, \ref{table:500-results}, it is clear that the  was the dominant algorithm. It is guarantee to find the optimal solution, what would make one wonders that it would be slower. Interestingly, quite the opposite happened: it outperformed all the other algorithms.

Notice that ILP did not solve the instances with 1000 vertices. That is not because it can't, but because the Gurobi license available doesn't allow one to run models that large.
