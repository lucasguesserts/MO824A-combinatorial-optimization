# Instructions

## Requirements

- Java 11
- Gradle 6.8.3

## Executing

Run the script with no args and it is gonna tell you how to use it.

```sh
./script/run
```

It is going to output the logs both on screen and in the file `ACTIVITY_4_DIR/run.log`.

If you have to change the instance it uses, consider changing the main methods (yes, it is hard coded).

## Using `pipenv`

```sh
# activate virtual python environment
pipenv shell
# install dependencies
pipenv install numpy
```
