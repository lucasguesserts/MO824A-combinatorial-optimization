## Credits

This project was developed by:

- Felipe Pereira
- Sandro Henrique Uliana Catabriga
- Lucas Guesser Targino da Silva (lucasguesserts@gmail.com)

The GRASP framework was initially developed by:

- FÃ¡bio Luiz Usberti (fusberti@ic.unicamp.br)
- Celso Cavellucci (celsocv@ic.unicamp.br)

## Requirements

- Java 11
- Gradle 6.8.3

## Executing

Run the script with no args and it is gonna tell you how to use it.

```sh
./script/run
```

It is going to output the logs both on screen and in the file `ACTIVITY_4_DIR/run.log`.

If you have to change the instance it uses, consider changing the main methods (yes, it is hard coded).

## Using `pipenv`

```sh
# activate virtual python environment
pipenv shell
# install dependencies
pipenv install numpy
```
